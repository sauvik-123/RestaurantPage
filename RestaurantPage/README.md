# 🍽️ Restaurant Website

## 🌟 Overview

This is a restaurant website that displays a menu with different food items. The menu items are shown as **cards** with an image, title, description, type, and price. The layout uses a **grid system** to center the cards and maintain spacing between them.

## 🍔 Functionality

- **🍳 Menu Cards**: Each card shows a food image, name, type (like breakfast), description, and price.
- **🟦 Grid Layout**: Cards are organized neatly in a grid with spacing and alignment.
- **🧭 Navigation**: Sections like Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner can be accessed through the top navigation.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes so the cards and sections remain centered and spaced properly.
- **🔘 Buttons**: Cards have interactive buttons (like order or add to cart) for user interaction.

## 🗂️ Structure

- **🖼️ Assets**: All images are stored in the `Assets` folder.
- **🧩 Components**: Cards and navigation are separate components for easy management.
